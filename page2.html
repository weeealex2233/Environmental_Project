                            car exhaust in the air. If you work in Chinatown, you are probably breathing polluted air
                            for eight or more hours a day. Even if you are a visitor to Chinatown and enjoying a
                            delicious Chinese meal with your friends, you are breathing in polluted air filled with high
                            levels of PM2.5 and ultra-fine particles. Nationwide, a PM2.5 has been going down, but not
                            in Chinatown.</p>
