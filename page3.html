                            and she spent many of her childhood days home sick. She’s not the only one who has learned
                            to link the refinery and the presence of illness in her community: A 2008 study (co-authored
                            by Grist board member Rachel Morello-Frosch) found that almost half of all homes in the area
                            had indoor levels of refinery-related particulate matter pollution that exceeded the state’s
                            air quality standards. </p>
